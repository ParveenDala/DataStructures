# DataStructures  
Data Structures in Java  
  
#1. Linked List  
> Create linked list  
> Traverse  
> Insert  
> Insert at position  
> Delete  
> Delete at position  
> Search  
> Reverse  
  
#2. Doubly Linked List  
> Create linked list  
> Traverse  
> Insert  
> Insert at position  
> Delete  
> Delete at position  
> Search  
> Reverse  
  
#3. Circular Linked List  
> Create linked list  
> Traverse  
> Insert  
> Insert at position  
> Delete  
> Delete at position  
> Search  
> Reverse  
  
#4. Stack Using Array  
> Push  
> Pop  
> Peek  
> isEmpty  
> isFull  
  
#5. Stack Using Linked List  
> Push  
> Pop  
> Peek  
> isEmpty  
> isFull (NA)  
  
#6. Linear Queue Using Array  
> Enqueue  
> Dequeue  
> isEmpty  
> isFull  

#7. Binary Tree Using Linked List  
> Traverse - LevelOrder, InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder  
> Insert Node  
> Delete Node  
> Search  
> Height Of The Tree  
> Deepest Of The Tree  

#8. Binary Search Tree Using Linked List  
> Traverse - LevelOrder, InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder  
> Insert Node  
> Delete Node  
> Search  
> Height Of The Tree
